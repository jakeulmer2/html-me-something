		        <p><b>I never thought as a college student studying business that I would end up on my current path.
				I started out painting houses through college.  I was good at it, but it wasn't fullfilling.  Then,
				I decided to try my hand at real estate.  Unfortunately, the housing market tanked, and I'm not much
				of a salesman!  It was back to painting.  Knowing I didn't want to paint forever, and having a business
				degree I applied for a sales job in the hospitality industry.  My friend helped me get the sales job I
				have today.  I started back in 2010.  Looking for something to further my career; I ran across 
				<a href="www.launchcode.org">LaunchCode</a> on Linkedin!</b></p>

				<p><b>This changed everything.  I started looking into programming, and found that I really enjoy it.  Seeing
				an opportunity and exciting possibilites, I jumped all over it.  I enrolled in LC101.  Now I believe I am finally 
				on the path to a more successful and enjoyable career that I can use to support my family.  Thank you LaunchCode!!!</b></p>

				<p><b>I am hopeful by the end of this class I will have the necessary skills to enhance my career.  Thus, making me a "Super Coder Hero!"</b></p>
